# P6

### a)

 we get 1000110000, with a remainder of R=0000. 

### b)      

we get 0101010101, with a remainder of R=1111. 

### c)  

 we get 1011010111, with a remainder of R=1001. 

# P7

### a)

Without loss of generality, suppose ith bit is flipped, where 0<= i <= d+r-1 and assume that the least significant bit is 0th bit. A single bit error means that the received data is K=D*2r XOR R + 2i. It is clear that if we divide K by G, then the reminder is not zero. In general, if G contains at least two 1’s, then a single bit error can always be detected.  

### b)

The key insight here is that G can be divided by 11 (binary number), but any number of odd-number of 1’s cannot be divided by 11. Thus, a sequence (not necessarily contiguous) of odd-number bit errors cannot be divided by 11, thus it cannot be divided by G.  

# P23

If all the 11=9+2 nodes send out data at the maximum possible rate of 100 Mbps, a total aggregate throughput of 11*100 = 1100 Mbps is possible. 

# P24

Each departmental hub is a single collision domain that can have a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps. The links connecting the web server and the mail server has a maximum throughput of 100 Mbps. Hence, if the three collision domains and the web server and mail server send out data at their maximum possible rates of 100 Mbps each, a maximum total aggregate throughput of 500 Mbps can be achieved among the 11 end systems. 

# P33

### a)

Both email and video application uses the fourth rack for 0.1 percent of the time. 

### b)

Probability that both applications need fourth rack is 0.001*0.001 = 10^-6.  

### c)

Suppose the first three racks are for video, the next rack is a shared rack for both video and email, and the
next three racks are for email. Let's assume that the fourth rack has all the data and software needed for both the email and video applications. With the topology of Figure 5.31, both applications will have enough intra-bandwidth as long as both are not simultaneously using the fourth rack. From part b, both are using the fourth rack for no more than .00001 %  of time, which is within the .0001% requirement.
