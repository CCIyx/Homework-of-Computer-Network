**x to z:**  

 x-y-z, x-y-w-z,  x-w-z, x-w-y-z, x-v-w-z, x-v-w-y-z, x-u-w-z, x-u-w-y-z,  x-u-v-w-z, x-u-v-w-y-z

**a)** Dx(w) = 2, Dx(y) = 4,  Dx(u) = 7 

**b)** First consider what happens if c(x,y) changes. If c(x,y)  becomes larger or smaller (as long as c(x,y) >=1) , the least cost path from x to u will still have cost at least 7. Thus a change in c(x,y) (if c(x,y)>=1) will not cause x to inform its neighbors of any changes.     

If c(x,y)= δ <1, then the least cost path now passes through y and has cost δ + 6.   

Now consider if c(x,w) changes. If c(x,w) = δ <= 1, then the least-cost path to u continues to pass through w and its cost changes to 5 + δ;  x will inform its neighbors of this new cost. If c(x,w) = δ > 6, then the least cost path now passes through y and has cost 11; again x will inform its neighbors of this new cost.    

**c)** Any change in link cost c(x,y) (and as long as c(x,y) >=1)  will not cause x to inform its neighbors of a new minimum-cost path to u .  

# P9

NO, this is because that decreasing link cost won’t cause a loop (caused by the next-hop relation of between two nodes of that link). Connecting two nodes with a link is equivalent to decreasing the link weight from infinite to the finite weight. 

# P13

The chosen path is not necessarily the shortest AS-path. Recall that there are many issues to be considered in the route selection process. It is very likely that a longer loop-free path is preferred over a shorter loop-free path due to economic reason. For example, an AS might prefer to send traffic to one neighbor instead of another neighbor with shorter AS distance. 

# P15

**a)** I1 because this interface begins the least cost path from 1d towards the gateway router 1c. 

**b)** I2. Both routes have equal AS-PATH length but I2 begins the path that has the closest NEXT-HOP router. 

**c)** I1. I1 begins the path that has the shortest AS-PATH.
