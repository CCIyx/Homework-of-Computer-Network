It is not possible to devise such a technique. In order to establish a direct TCP connection between Arnold and Bernard, either Arnold or Bob must initiate a connection to the other. But the NATs covering Arnold and Bob drop SYN packets arriving from the WAN side. Thus neither Arnold nor Bob can initiate a TCP connection to the other if they are both behind NATs.
